# RNNStockPricePredictor
This is a Google Colab notebook that uses transformed transactional trading data for $AAPL to make predictions on the direction of the stock price. The data is transformed into 5 minute bins with features such as price high, low, and mean, volume, time of day, and day of week. The dataset itself is not included as it is expensive to procure and is not required to demonstrate the techniques in the Jupyter notebook.

The Data Pipeline.ipynb file shows the ETL pipeline changing the dataset of every price recorded in the years of 2000-2010, into 5 minute increments that also extracts features of price high, low, and mean; volumn high, low, and mean; and times of day as categorical variables. Due to the size of the data, the Pandas chunking function is used to transform the data that fits into the memory of Google Colab.

For making predictions I used a Recurrent Neural Network that has LSTM, Dropout, and Dense layers using Keras frontend and Tensorflow backend. In order to simulate the performance of the model in a streaming context, we use walk-forward validation to train the neural network over time, incrementally changing weights over the dataset. We acheive a ROC-AUC of 92% during the walk-forward validation that uses 2^9*50 rows.
